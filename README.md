How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by starting with the customer and then working from there, if the customer is looking to have a certain outcome or result from what they are requesting then creating an application or program that can meet or exceed those expectations is my highest priority.
Test cases can be a tremendous help in this endeavour as they can itemize or break down this "concept" into smaller, actionable tasks that are then more easily developed from that point onward.
Continuously utilizing these 2 approaches leads to a successful outcome when it comes to delivering on a customer's expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I hope I can incorporate effective communication and flexibility when I'm developing programs, understanding that things are constantly evolving and changing and thus understanding the need for programs and applications to follow suit is a tough pill to swallow.
Understanding that with a strong foundation and continuous communication with all moving parts within a team can lead to incredibly positive outcomes is comforting, as there is an aspect of working towards a goal as a unit that is truly aspirational to me.
Agile processes such as flexibility, understanding the specific "Done" characteristics and having a clear path forward as a developer are just a few that I know will be incredibly impactful in my journey as a developer.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development, and in any other business area, is to understand your role within your team and fulfill it, communicating your needs and allowing your teammates to rely on you when necessary, and more than anything,
continuously improving, one will never know everything there is to know, but as long as there's improvement throughout the journey, then eventually bigger and better things will come.
